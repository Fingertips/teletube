# Upload a video

You can use a channel id, upload id, and a title to create a new video with the upload.

    teletube videos create --channel-id <id> --upload-id <id> --title "Very serious video about nature."

You can set other details about the video too, please use `--help` to see them.

    teletube videos create --help

# Videos

Look up a channel id with the channels listing explained earlier. Then you can list all videos in that channel.

    teletube videos list --channel-id <id>

# Files

A video may have multiple files, one for each attempted processing job.

    teletube files list --video-id <id>

Each will have a URL and an optional original files. You can attempt to download the latest file uploaded this way.

    teletube files download --video-id <id>

Keep in mind that the download URLs will expire, so you shouldn't share them with others.

# Upload a document with a video

    teletube files upload DOCUMENT.DOCX

This should print a NO_CONTENT response for every 50 megabytes uploaded. Error messages are handled as long as the command keeps running.

    teletube files upload AVATAR.JPG

This should print a NO_CONTENT response for every 50 megabytes uploaded. Error messages are handled as long as the command keeps running.

Copy-paste the characters after ðŸ“ƒ, this is the upload id.

# Help

You can always end a command with `--help` to get more details. For example:

    teletube --help
    teletube browse --help
    teletube browse poster --help
    
#  JSON

Status information about the command is printed to `stderr`. JSON responses are written to `stdout` so you can use tools like `jq` to get details.

For example, you can format the JSON for readability.

    teletube channels list --role owner | jq

Or you can transform it to only show the `id` and `name`.

    teletube channels list --role owner | jq ".[] | {id: .id, name: .name}"

The best way to learn `jq` is through the tutorial [https://stedolan.github.io/jq/tutorial/](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/tutorial/) and trying it out on [https://jqplay.org](https://jqplay.org).
